## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering and Automation at South China University of Technology, currently pursuing a Joint Training PhD at the National University of Singapore under the supervision of Prof. Jimmy Peng (Aug 2024 – Present). My research focuses on explicit model-based reliability/resilience assessment, digital planning of smart distribution networks, power grid planning under climate change, and advanced optimization and AI-combined methods. As the student leader of the laboratory’s distribution networks planning group, I coordinate projects, organize academic discussions, and contribute to developing intelligent digital planning software for modern distribution networks.

I have published 14 journal papers, including 3 SCI papers and 4 EI journal papers as first or corresponding author, with 2 IEEE Transactions papers and 1 book under review. I hold 1 authorized invention patent and have contributed to high-impact projects for China Southern Power Grid and other institutions, earning recognition from academicians like Li Licheng and Wang Chengshan. My work has been applied in practical planning areas such as Pazhou, Songshan Lake, and Guangxi.
